This one was OK. I dont remember how long it took me but I finished an hour early and had to redo it because none of my code used returns. I held all my results in global arrays and would push results into them. This did work but its not very good and could lead to errors down the line since there is no pop function. anyway this was a pretty fun one till I had to redo it. I also usually use silly name references from shows im watching but I thought id leave this one slightly more professional. If you want to see them then go through the push history.
